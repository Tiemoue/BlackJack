## Objective 
Blackjack is a popular gambling card game in which players attempt to make a hand as close as possible to a sum of 21 without going over. A player may hit as many times as they want, but if they go over 21, they bust - or automatically lose.

## Card Values

An ace is worth 11.<br />
face cards (Jacks, Queens, and Kings) are worth 10. <br />
Any other card is its pip value.

## Game key terms

y: To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. <br />
n: To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn. <br />
Bust: If your card total goes over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.

## Dealings
Each player is dealt an initial hand of 2 cards. The first player may then choose to hit (draw another card into their hand) or stand, which means keep their current hand, and play passes to the next player. A player may hit as many times as they want, but if they go over 21, they bust - or automatically lose.
The dealer plays their turn last. The dealer plays by a fixed set of rules. They must stand if their hand is over 17. Otherwise, they must continue to hit until they reach over 17.
